# Regular Expressions

At the end of the [previous section on Emacs](08_emacs.md), you
learned how to `tags-query-replace` to search and replace across many
files at once.  These searches consist of _regular expressions_, a
mini pattern-matching language distinct from and more powerful than
shell _wildcards_.  For those who have read prior sections on Unix,
Emacs's regexps are implemented a bit differently than in the `grep`
and `sed` commands.  For the benefit those Windows users who have only
read the section on Emacs, this section reviews some of the same
terminology.  Emacs regexps also vary slightly from those in major
programming languages, but here is where you'll likely get the most
use out of them when routinely editing files. This section shows you
how to apply regular expressions to a bunch of useful editing
scenarios. By the end, you will be able to build a regexp that matches
passive-voice constructions.

1.  For this unit, specify all the markdown source files for global
    search and replace, then open any file:

        $ etags *.md ; emacs TAGS

    Run the same `tags-query-replace` command you learned about in the
    previous unit. You'll be doing that repeatedly for all these
    searches. You can make the changes or not, or decide not to save
    the changes after you make them.

1.  Search for `DELETE` and change to `__DELETE__`. (In markdown, the
    double underscores format the text as __bold__.)

1.  Search for `TAB` and change to `__TAB__`. These are simple
    searches for `literal` text.

    - _literal_

1.  Suppose you have a lot of different text in ALL CAPS that you want
    to format as bold. One way to do it is to search for the following
    typical regular expression:

        \b\([A-Z][A-Z]+\)\b

    Then change it to:

        __\1__

1.  Pick apart how the regexp works:

    - The `\b` at the start and end marks a _word boundary_. The
      boundary itself doesn't match any text, and also referred to as
      `zero-width` or as a `positioner`.  This example prevents
      matches within words, such as _XMLHttpRequest_ or _JSONPath_.

    - The `\(` and `\)` captures the text, so that you can use `\1` to
      insert it back in the replacement. This is also often called a
      `group` or a `trap`.

    - The `[A-Z]` defines a custom _character class_, in this case a
      single character that's a range of possible matches: any
      uppercase letter.

    - The `+` is a _quantifier_ that means _one or more of whatever
      comes before_, in this case another `[A-Z]` character class.

    In practice, the two character classes in a row followed by the
    `+` means _two or more_ uppercase characters, which ignores common
    matches such as `A` and `I` in text.

    - _character class_
    - _quantifier_
    - _capture_, _group_, _trap_
    - _boundary_, _positioner_, _zero-width_

1.  That search casts a wide net, and may yield far too many ALL CAPS
    matches to be useful.  If you have a narrower set of things you
    want to change at once, you can search for something like this:

        \b\(TAB\|DELETE\|RETURN\|SHIFT\)\b

    Within the `\(` ... `\)` group, the `\|` serve as _alternators_, 
    so that each _sequence_ of text may match separately.

    Note that parentheses and bar characters match literally by
    themselves, but get this special grouping behavior when preceded
    by a backslash. This is the opposite of how it works for most
    other metacharacters in Emacs.  For example, `[` by itself opens a
    custom character class, while `\[` matches the literal `[`
    character.

    - _alternators_
    - _sequence_

1.  The `[A-Z]` above is a _custom_ character class, but often you use
    built-in classes, the most important of which is the dot (`.`)
    metacharacter, which stands for _any character within a line_,
    anything except for a linefeed character. (A _metacharacter_ is
    one that has a special meaning within a regular expression, the
    opposite of a literal.)

    Suppose you have some quoted text such as "this" and "that" that
    should convert to inline `monospace` formatting. Search for this
    regexp:

        "\(.+\)"

    Replace with:

        `\1`

    - _custom character class_
    - _metacharacter_

1.  There's a problem with this search.  What if "this" and "that"
    both appear on the same line, as they actually did above?  By
    default, the `+` quantifier after the `.` matches _as many
    characters as possible_, so `"this" and "that"` match rather than
    `"this"` and `"that"` separately. This is called a _greedy_ match.
    Adding a `?` after the quantifier makes it a _lazy_ match:

        "\(.+?\)"

    That translates to: one or more non-linefeed characters, up to the
    very _first_ double-quote character the match encounters. Lazy
    matches need to be followed by something that is certain to match,
    or nothing will.

    - _greedy match_
    - _lazy match_

1.  What if the text to match falls on separate lines?

        Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah "this
        text" blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah "that
        text" blah blah.

    The dot (`.`) matches any character _except_ the one that
    separates lines, so you need to use a different approach to match
    the text.  Find out if there's some character that _doesn't_
    appear in your text, and define a character class that matches
    anything that's _not_ that character.  For example, tab characters
    are typically excluded from text.  Within the search, define a
    custom class (`[]`), add a caret character to reverse it (`[^]`),
    followed by the tab character itself. Follow the class with the
    lazy quantifier. Together, it looks like this:

        "\([^	]+?\)"

1.  What if there's punctuation within the quotes, but you want to
    place it outside the font formatting specified in the replacement?
    Maybe you're searching on "this," "that," and "the other."  Add
    another group to the previous search to specify punctuation
    characters such as commas and periods:

        "\([^	]+?\)\([,.]?\)"

    What does this do? The `[,.]` specifies the punctuation, as a
    custom class of discrete characters rather than a range like you
    saw before.  Note that within the custom class, the dot `.`
    character is treated as a literal. The `?` is quantifier that
    means _zero or one_, so that the match is optional. The lazy
    quantifier in the first group matches only up until the optional
    match in the second group, so the regexp matches cases with or
    without punctuation such as "this" and "that."  This is the
    replacement, where the contents of the second group `\2` may
    consist of empty text when no punctuation is present:

        `\1`\2

1.  You can cast a wider net to match any other punctuation that may
    appear within the quotes. Note that like the dot, the question
    mark is treated literally within the character class:

        "\([^	]+?\)\([,.!?:;]?\)"

1.  There's a less ugly way to do it. Use the `\s.` built-in class,
    which stands for _any punctuation character_, broadly defined to
    include many characters that don't often appear in prose. This is
    the alternate regexp:

        "\([^	]+?\)\(\s.?\)"

1.  There's even more built-in syntax available for _Posix_ classes,
    which follow a named `[:class:]` format:

        "\([^	]+?\)\([:punct:]?\)"

    Don't mistake these for custom classes. You can actually specify
    them _within_ classes, like the following that matches any
    non-whitespace, non-punctuation character:

        [^[:space:][:punct:]]

1.  There's another quantifier available, `*`, which stands for _zero
    or more_.  Suppose these three words appear in text: `prince`,
    `princes`, and `princess`.

    Searching for `princes?` (zero or one) matches `prince` or
    `princes`.

    Searching for `princes+` (one or more) matches `princes` or
    `princess`.

    Searching for `princes*` (zero or more) matches all three.

1.  This regexp shows a couple of other built-in classes, along with a
    useful technique you can use to find repeated words:

        \b\(\w+\)\s-+\1\b

    The `\w` stands for any alphanumeric _word_ character, and the
    `\s-` means any whitespace character. This regexp captures any
    word that's followed by whitespace, followed by the same word
    again, all bounded with `\b` positioners to keep from matching
    text such as `an angle`.

    You typically use `\1` in replacements, but you can also specify
    it in searches to refer to text you've already trapped.

    You can also use the `\sw` code to refer to word characters.  You
    can include any built-in code that starts with `\s` within custom
    classes. For example, `[^\s.\s-]` matches characters that are
    neither punctuation nor whitespace.

1.  Here are a few other zero-width positioners that come in handy.
    The `^` character stands for _start of line_. Replacing this with
    a dash `-` allows you to change all the numbered lists here to
    bullet lists:

        ^[0-9]+\.

    Note the backslash before the dot character. You're matching the
    number followed by a literal dot (such as `1.`), so you have to
    _escape_ the metacharacter to interpret it literally. Otherwise it
    would match any character.  You'd have to treat other
    metacharacters literally within searches, such as `\[` for an open
    square brace. You'd have to escape a literal backslash `\\` in
    both searches and replacements.

    - escape

1.  The `$` character stands for _end of line_.  When editing code,
    it's often considered bad form to allow extra spaces at the end of
    lines. Searching for a space character followed by `+$` allows you
    to remove them all.

1.  These positioning characters get disabled when they don't appear
    contextually at the start or end of the match. That means `$\w+`
    matches certain `$variable` names without any fuss.

1.  The <code>\\\`</code> code stands for the start of the file (or
    editing buffer).  Search for this and
    replace with nothing to remove extra space at the start of the
    file:

        \`\s-+

1.  The `\'` code stands for the end of the file. What if you want to
    make sure there's a carriage return at the end of the file, which
    is also considered good form when editing code? Search for this:

        \(.\)\'

    But you can't type a carriage return in the replacement without it
    being interpreted as responding to Emacs's minibuffer prompt mode.
    The following two steps offer two different ways to do it, first
    the more involved way, then the simpler way.

1.  You can copy (kill) the text, and paste (yank) it into the
    replacment.  Go to the end of any line (`CTRL-e`), kill the
    subsequent linefeed, (`CTRL-k`), and yank it back into the text
    (`CTRL-y`). Then later when specifying replacement text, type
    `CTRL-y` to yank it again, this time into the minibuffer.

1.  The simpler way to insert a literal linefeed character anywhere
    within Emacs is to type the __C-q C-j__ sequence. Searching for a
    sequence of three of those followed by a `+` plus sign, then
    replacing with a sequence of two, makes sure there's only one
    blank line in a row.

1.  The next example shows how to search for many passive-voice
    constructions. While useful, it's sufficiently complex (or at
    least long) that if you use it you're likely to save it in a file
    and copy and paste it when searching:

        \b\(were\|was\|is\|are\|be\|ha[sd]\s-+been\)\(\s-+\w+\)?\s-+\w+e[dn]\b

    It consists of two grouped sequences followed by an ungrouped
    sequence.  The first group specifies the word _were_, _was_, _is_,
    _are_, _be_, or the phrases _has been_ or _had been_.

    The second group specifies an optional word preceded by
    whitespace.  Note the `?` after the group.  Earlier you saw this
    quantifier follow a character class to indicate an optional
    punctuation character, but here it means the entire grouped
    sequence of characters is optional.

    The final sequence specifies whitespace, then any word ending
    either `ed` or `en`.

    With the optional second group, the regexp matches both `is
    recommended` and `is strongly recommended`.

1.  What if you want to match the entire passive-voice regular
    expression above and mark it with text such as `FIX=>` and
    `<=FIX`?  Simply surround the entire expression with `\(` and `\)`
    and invoke `\1` in the replacement. A group may contain nested
    groups.

1.  One final feature, then you're done. Suppose you want to lowercase
    some HTML anchor links:

        #camelCase
        #mixOfUpperAndLower

    Search for `\(#\w+\)` and replace with:

        \,(downcase \1)

    The `\,` marks what follows in the parentheses as a Lisp
    expression to evaluate in the replacement text. You can do the
    same to `\,(capitalize \1)` the match. The following search and
    replace applies title case throughout markdown headings:

        ^\(#+ *\)(.+)
        \1\,(capitalize \2)

    You can also `\,(upcase \2)` to convert text to ALL CAPS.
