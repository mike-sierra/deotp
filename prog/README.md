# Deep End of the Pool Programming

- First you learn how to run a simple program, how to test little bits
  of code in an interactive emulator, and how the basic syntax works.
- Then you learn how to deal with numeric values, and how to do basic
  arithmetic.
- Then you learn how to store values for re-use.
- Then you learn how to deal with more free-form text values, and how
  to get text in and out of files.
- Then you learn how to make decisions, and all about truth and
  existence.
- Then you learn how to store sequences of many values.
- Then you learn how to loop over these sequences to do something with
  each item.
- Then you learn how to convert strings to sequences and back.
- Then you learn about lookup tables, which offer another way bundle
  data together.
- After that, you learn how to create your own reusable code functions
  to perform common actions.
- Then you learn how to design a command-line interface.
- Then you learn how to create shared, reusable code libraries.
- Finally, you learn about object-oriented programming, where you
  combine data and functionality together.
