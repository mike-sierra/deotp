# Deep End of the Pool Programming

First you learn how to run a simple program, how to test little bits
of code in an interactive emulator, and how the basic syntax works.
Then you learn how to deal with numeric values, and how to perform
simple arithmetic.  Then you learn how to store values for re-use.
Then you learn how to deal with string data to store text. Then you
learn how to make decisions. Then you learn how to store arrays
(sequences) of many values. Then you learn how to loop over each item
in the array.  Then you learn how to convert strings to arrays and
back. Then you learn about objects, which provide another way to
collect a set of data.
