## Linguistics

- Not required, but conventionally variable names are _snake\_case_ in Python and Perl, and _camelCase_ in JavaScript.

- Python's errors don't always tell you exactly what you did wrong.

- Python doesn't support _increment_/_decrement_ expressions such as `foo++` or `foo--`, but you can easily substitute `foo+=1` or `foo-=1`
