## Linguistics

- Some languages do not distinguish integer and floating-point numbers, and figure it out on the fly, so that `0.7 + 0.3` is `1`

- Python also supports both _long_ and _complex_ number types

- In Python 3, dividing integers yields a float, so that `11 / 3` is `3.6666`

- Methods are often called _functions_ when called by themselves, rather than called from a parent object with dot notation.
