# Getting Started

1.  Your Mac is made out of Unix, but you need to open a command-line
    _terminal_ to see that. To open your terminal from the Finder,
    choose __Go&rArr;Applications__. Then navigate to the
    __Utilities__ subdirectory.  Open __Terminal.app__.  Once it
    displays in the dock, Option-click on the icon and choose
    __Options&rArr;Keep In Dock__, because it'll be an important tool
    for you.

    At each step throughout this guide, you'll see a list of each new
    bit of jargon you encounter, for example:

    - _terminal_

1.  By default, the terminal displays as a small window with
    black-on-white text that's hard to see and may cause eye strain.
    Your should change that. Under
    __Terminal&rArr;Preferences&rArr;Settings__, choose the
    __Homebrew__ theme. Under the __Startup__ tab, select __New window
    with settings__ along with the __Homebrew__ theme.  Under
    __View__, choose __Bigger__ until the terminal better fills the
    screen.  Then under the __Shell__ menu, choose __Use Settings as
    Default__. Quit out of the terminal, then open it up again. You
    should get a window that looks like it did when you quit. If you
    don't like __Homebrew__, choose some other theme or font size and
    save until you get it right.

1.  Once you open the terminal, you are in a _shell_ environment, a
    command-line interface that pre-dates mouse-driven graphic user
    interfaces.  The shell allows you to interact with the computer's
    file system using a bunch of different Unix _utilities_, which the
    following sections discuss. The command-line may seem daunting at
    first, but you can do a lot of things there that are more
    difficult in a graphic interface.

    - _shell_
    - _file system_
